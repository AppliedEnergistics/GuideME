# Search

GuideME uses [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) to dynamically build a search index 
for your guidebook and offer powerful search.

At the moment, all content is indexed using English language rules, but 
in the future, you will be able to specify the default language of your
guide to benefit from Lucenes language-specific indexing.

Here's an example of the search in action:

<video controls>
  <source src={require('./guide-search.mp4').default}/>
</video>
