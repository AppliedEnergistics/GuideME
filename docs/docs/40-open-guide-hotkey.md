# Open Guide Hotkey

GuideME registers its own keybind (`G`) for opening a relevant guide page directly from an item-tooltip.

To make use of this functionality for your own guide, make sure to set appropriate item ids in the [item_ids frontmatter](./30-authoring/index.md#declaring-pages-as-itemlink-targets)
of your guide pages, which also enables the `<ItemLink />` functionality.
